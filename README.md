# Stroke Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset related to strokes. Strokes are a critical health issue, and understanding the underlying factors is essential for preventive healthcare measures. This EDA aims to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights within the dataset to contribute to the broader understanding of stroke risk factors.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis comprises various attributes that may be associated with stroke occurrences. Each record represents an individual, with features covering demographic, lifestyle, and health-related information. The dataset provides a valuable resource for studying the relationships between these attributes and the likelihood of experiencing a stroke.

## Attributes
**id**: Unique identifier for each individual.<br>
**gender**: Gender of the individual (Male/Female/Other).<br>
**age**: Age of the individual.<br>
**hypertension**: Whether the individual has hypertension (1: Yes, 0: No).<br>
**heart_disease**: Whether the individual has heart disease (1: Yes, 0: No).<br>
**ever_married**: Whether the individual has ever been married (Yes/No).<br>
**work_type**: Type of work the individual is engaged in (Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, children, Never_worked).<br>
**residence_type**: Type of residence (Urban/Rural).<br>
**avg_glucose_level**: Average glucose level in the individual's blood.<br>
**bmi**: Body mass index of the individual.<br>
**smoking_status**: Smoking status of the individual (formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, unknown).<br>
**stroke**: Whether the individual had a stroke (1: Yes, 0: No).<br>
